Content of the repository:

* omp_cosmoStat.cpp, omp_cosmoStat.h 
  - implementation of various estimators (power spectrum, bispectrum, integrated bispectrum, line correlation function) to measure statistics from N-body data
* util.cpp, util.h 
  - helper class, which handles all the gridding in real and Fourier space
* load_snapshot.cpp, proto.h 
  - routines to read in particle data in the GADGET file format
* zbox2.cpp 
  - main file; contains a full implementation, which reads in and processes data from the ZBOX2 simulations (stored on Apollo), then measures a specified statistic

* makefile 
  - compiles all necessary code and creates the executable 'zbox2'
* job.sh
  - submission script
